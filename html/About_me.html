    <h4>About me:</h4>

    <p>My name is Lance Taylor! I love being with people, being with my family, 
        and of course love spending time with my wife. My wife and I got 
        married in March of 2024. My wife and I were High School sweethearts and 
        attended Timpview High School in Provo Utah. In High School I played 
        soccer and kicked for our football team. Now I still enjoy soccer but I 
        enjoy all different sports especailly pickleball, I also enjoy the outdoors.
        I plan on becoming a dentist and my wife is planning on becoming a sonographer.
        I served a full time mission for the chirch of Jesus Chrsit of Latter-Day Saints
        in Lima Peru. I love different cultures and especailly the culture in latin mareica.
        My passions are serving people, being happy, and being physically active!</p>
